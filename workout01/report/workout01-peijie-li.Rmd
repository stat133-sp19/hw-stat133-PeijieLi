The Golden State Warriors have made a habit of bringing statistical impossibilities into reality. As Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry share the spotlight of leading Golden State to back-to-back NBA championships, it is easy to forget that the Warriors also employ many other best-performing shooters. Where do these current stars, including but not limited to Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry, outperform the others? In this article we present a close look at the shooting performance of some outstanding current Golden State Warriors players: Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and the last but not the least, Andre Iguodala.

## Motivation

## Background & Data
Include an overview of each player
Include Statistics


## Analysis
Include overall chart and table. Compare them
Compare shot skills for 2PT, 3PT and overall

```{r out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('../images/gsw-shot-charts.png')
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(gridExtra)
df <- read.csv("../data/shots-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df <- mutate(df, shot_yes_2pt = ifelse(shot_type == "2PT Field Goal" & shot_made_flag == "shot_yes", 1, 0))
df <- mutate(df, shot_yes_3pt = ifelse(shot_type == "3PT Field Goal" & shot_made_flag == "shot_yes", 1, 0))
df <- mutate(df, shot_2pt = ifelse(shot_type == "2PT Field Goal", 1, 0))
df <- mutate(df, shot_3pt = ifelse(shot_type == "3PT Field Goal", 1, 0))
```

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
twopt <- filter(df, shot_type == "2PT Field Goal")
twopt <- summarise(group_by(twopt, name), total = sum(shot_2pt), made = sum(shot_yes_2pt))
twopt <- mutate(twopt, perc_made = made * 100.0 /total)
twopt <- arrange(twopt, desc(perc_made))
```

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
threept <- filter(df, shot_type == "3PT Field Goal")
threept <- summarise(group_by(threept, name), total = sum(shot_3pt), made = sum(shot_yes_3pt))
threept <- mutate(threept, perc_made = made * 100.0 /total)
threept <- arrange(threept, desc(perc_made))
```

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
totalpt <- summarise(group_by(df, name), total = sum(shot_2pt+shot_3pt), made = sum(shot_yes_2pt+shot_yes_3pt))
totalpt <- mutate(totalpt, perc_made = made * 100.0 /total)
totalpt <- arrange(totalpt, desc(perc_made))
```

2PT Effective Shooting Percentage of GSW Players:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(twopt, caption = "2PT Effective Shooting Percentage by Player")
```

3PT Effective Shooting Percentage of GSW Players:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(threept, caption = "3PT Effective Shooting Percentage by Player")
```

(Overall) Effective Shooting Percentage of GSW Players:

```{r echo=FALSE, result="asis"}
knitr::kable(totalpt, caption = "Effective Shooting Percentage by Player")
```
