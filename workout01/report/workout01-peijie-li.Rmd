##### The Golden State Warriors have made a habit of bringing statistical impossibilities into reality. As Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry share the spotlight of leading Golden State to back-to-back NBA championships, it is easy to forget that the Warriors also employ many other best-performing shooters. Where do these current stars, including but not limited to Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry, outperform the others? In this article we present a close look at the shooting performance of some outstanding current Golden State Warriors players: Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and the last but not the least, Andre Iguodala.

## The Top Five Players

### Kevin Durant
Born on September 29, 1988 in Suitland, Maryland, just outside of Washington, D.C., Kevin Wayne Durant is a high-profile professional basketball player. After joining the Golden State Warriors in 2016, Durant led the team to back-to-back NBA championships:

In June 2017, he led the Warriors to victory over LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA finals, scoring 39 points in the Game 5 clincher to cement Golden State's second championship in three years. During the season, Durant averaged 35.2 points, 8.4 rebounds and 5.4 assists throughout the series, earning finals MVP honors for his performance. In 2018, Durant continued to show show his leadership when his celebrated teammate, two-time MVP Stephen Curry, suffered from knee injuries late in the season. Durant carried his team through the early rounds of the playoffs, and with Curry back to full strength, the Warriors swept the Cavaliers in their finals rematch. This year Durant successfully claimed his second straight finals MVP award.

## Effective Shooting Percentage of Top 5

Two-point, Three-point, and overall effective shooting percentage tables of the top 5 GSW players are presented below:

#### Two-Point Effective Shooting:

```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(gridExtra)
df <- read.csv("../data/shots-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df <- mutate(df, shot_yes_2pt = ifelse(shot_type == "2PT Field Goal" & shot_made_flag == "shot_yes", 1, 0))
df <- mutate(df, shot_yes_3pt = ifelse(shot_type == "3PT Field Goal" & shot_made_flag == "shot_yes", 1, 0))
df <- mutate(df, shot_2pt = ifelse(shot_type == "2PT Field Goal", 1, 0))
df <- mutate(df, shot_3pt = ifelse(shot_type == "3PT Field Goal", 1, 0))
```

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
twopt <- filter(df, shot_type == "2PT Field Goal")
twopt <- summarise(group_by(twopt, name), total = sum(shot_2pt), made = sum(shot_yes_2pt))
twopt <- mutate(twopt, perc_made = made * 100.0 /total)
twopt <- arrange(twopt, desc(perc_made))
```

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
threept <- filter(df, shot_type == "3PT Field Goal")
threept <- summarise(group_by(threept, name), total = sum(shot_3pt), made = sum(shot_yes_3pt))
threept <- mutate(threept, perc_made = made * 100.0 /total)
threept <- arrange(threept, desc(perc_made))
```

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
totalpt <- summarise(group_by(df, name), total = sum(shot_2pt+shot_3pt), made = sum(shot_yes_2pt+shot_yes_3pt))
totalpt <- mutate(totalpt, perc_made = made * 100.0 /total)
totalpt <- arrange(totalpt, desc(perc_made))
```
