# workout01: GSW Shot Charts:

The purpose of this assignment is threefold: 1) From the logistical point of view, this assignment gives the opportunity to start working with a more complex file structure, and uploading files to GitHub. 2) From the analytics point of view, this HW involves visualizing shot data of NBA players. More especifically, in this homework I produce so-called "shot charts" for a handful of players from the Golden State Warriors, as well as other summaries and visualizations. 3) From the report/communication standpoint, I produce a report document that is not just a boring list of code-and-output without a narrative.
